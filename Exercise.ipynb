    "\t- What sample size is needed?\n",
    "\t- What data do we need to prove or refute the hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "When forming your hypothesis, it's important to find data that will disprove your hypothesis.  It's infeasible to to be 100% correct with, so what you need to do is be highly certain event x will impact event y.\n",
    "\t- Margin of error: The maoun that the results of our survey will differ from the real population value\n",
    "\t- Confidence level: The probability that if we were to run another survey with the same metrics it would return the same results\n",
    "\t- Population size: Size of the population we're collecting data on\n",
    "\t- Likely sample proportion: The percentage of people surveyed whose results we anticipate matching the expected outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Date-a-Scientist dataset has 200 entries, meaning that our current sample size is equal to 200. If we have a 5% margin of error, 95% confidence level, and a likely sample proportion of 50%, what size does our overall population need to be?\n",

    "What if the population of Date-a-Scientist users is closer to 5,000? Keeping the same values for margin of error, confidence level, and likely sample proportion, what should the size of our sample be?\n",

    "\t- Which data are relevant\n",
    "\t- Are there privacy issues?\n",

    "4. Clean and organize data\n",
    "\t- Is the data readable\n",
    "\t- Get rid of uncessary values\n",
